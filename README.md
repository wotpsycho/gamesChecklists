# Games Checklists

Personal Coding Project created on accident to create an interactive checklist with Pre-Req dependencies. 
Mainly used to play around with GoogleAppsScripts, ES6, Typescript, and functional programming.
Main development/master checklist can be found at:

Feel free to make a copy to play around with, though since it is a development version it may be broken as changes are being made.
You will need to grant permissions to use most Actions, use menu "Add-ons" -> "Games Checklist" -> "Attach Triggers" (looking into better UX required before making public).

## ##NOTE##
This is not ready for public use and actual README and USAGE information will be provided at a later date. Only making available for demo purposes at the moment.
